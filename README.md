# 🏙️ Civic Issue Reporting & Management System

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **real problem-based web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It provides a digital platform for citizens to **report issues in their area**, such as road damage, sanitation, or public utility problems, and allows the municipal corporation to **monitor, manage, and resolve** them efficiently.

It aims to bridge the communication gap between the **public** and **local authorities** — making civic problem-solving more transparent and interactive.

## 💬 How It Works
1. Users register complaints with location and details.
2. The complaint appears on the home feed and can be searched or filtered.
3. The municipal admin views all complaints on their dashboard.
4. Admin updates the status or comments once a problem is resolved.
5. The user can view updates and interact through their profile.
